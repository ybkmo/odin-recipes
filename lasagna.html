        lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled
        noodles and a tomato or white sauce. Lasagna, in the singular, is a
        southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in
        the plural.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade
        lasagna recipe:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em><strong>Meat:</strong></em> This lasagna recipe starts with a
          pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><strong>Onion:</strong></em> A diced onion is cooked until
          translucent with the ground meat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong></em> You'll need a can of tomato
          sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong></em> For fresh flavor, chop two
          tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><strong>Sugar:</strong></em> A dash of sugar balances out all of
          the acidity from the tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><strong>Noodles:</strong></em> Of course, you'll need lasagna
          noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the
          oven-ready variety to save time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><strong>Cheese:</strong></em> The cheese layer is made up of
          cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><strong>Eggs:</strong></em> Eggs make the cheese layer extra
          creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the
          layer together).
        </li>
      </ul>

          until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of
